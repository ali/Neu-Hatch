### Introduction

This is a simple ember application meant to get the ball rolling client side.

### SETUP

Setup is pretty much good out of the box, just serve the `Neu-Hatch/client/src` directory with the python command

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### TODO

- authentication / authorization
- export to csv
- better search interface


### DONE

- simple oauth redirects
- tweet display
- basic boiler plate
